            <h2 style="font-size: 28px; margin-bottom: 20px;">A Bioreactor for In Vitro Testing of Bone Graft:</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333; text-align: left;">
                Unicameral Bone Cysts(UBCs) are found primarily in children and cause severe pain if left untreated. During 
                treatment, surgeons extract fluid from the cysts and fill the void with bone-graft biomaterial. This surgical 
                treatment can be expensive and requires a longer recovery period. In order to minimize cost and recovery time, a 
                minimally invasive treatment procedure is ideal. The goal of this project is to create a bone-graft biomaterial 
                that is easily injected into the UBC patient and it can still mimic the mechanical properties of natural bone. To 
                test this biomaterial, a bioreactor will also be fabricated to test the samples in an environment that mimics the 
                in vivo conditions in the body. The final injectable biomaterial will help make UBC treatment more
                 accessible to patients by providing a minimally invasive treatment that lowers cost and recovery time.

                The bioreactor is a glass vessel equipped with a stirring bar placed on top of a magnetic stirrer with a heating plate. 
                Bone grafts are created with calcium sulfate. Compression tests was conducted on multiple bone grafts for analysis of mechanical
                properties. Bone grafts are placed within the bioreactor for a duration of 7 days. Phenol red is added to the solution to monitor 
                pH changes. A thermistor is probed into the solution to monitor the temperature change. An amplifier circuit is built for 
                the thermistor, and a beefcake relay is integrated into the circuit to protect the low-voltage Arduino microcontroller 
                from the 110V high-voltage source. The data collected was analyzed using MATLAB to check if temperature was indeed consistently
                around 37 degrees and if the bone graft samples mechanical properties are close to native bones.
