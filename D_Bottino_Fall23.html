        <div class="details" style="font-size: 20px;"> 	
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Currently in the market, multiple technologies exist that help measure the physical properties of 
            materials. However, these technologies can be either extremely expensive to purchase or too big in scale that makes them 
            unsuitable for small-scale mechanical tests. The available microscale mechanical testing device could be hard to operate and require special training. 
            One goal of this project is to create a user-friendly microdevice that can test the physical properties of a small biomaterial while, ideally, sustaining the cell life. 
            <br>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The demand of settings for chemical testing varies from experiment to experiment, and therefore there isn’t a panacea
            chemical testing device and engineers need to carefully evaluate these demands and create devices that meet them. The second goal of this project is to create microdevices that 
            meet the specific needs of each experiment to facilitate the research progress.

            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So far, multiple 3D models for chemical testing have been created, a circuit for a mechanical testing microdevice has 
        been designed and tested and a linear actuator has been modeled.</p>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Figure I shows a chamber that is designed for cell-migration study. In the design, there is a vacancy at the bottom 
        which allows the injection of hydrogel and nutrients that allows the migration and sustain cell viability on 
        the device. Cells will grow on the meshes. The empty rectangular platforms are designated as observatory platforms 
        that can fit well under the microscope.</p> <br><br>

            <b> Figure I: Migration Study 3D Model </b><br><br><br>
        </div>
            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Figure II, III combined is a device that serves to do chemical testing. The device has 6 chambers, 
            and they are all interconnected through the meshes on the platform walls(Figure II). The outer walls are designed to be 
            inlets and outlets and will form a circulating system with the assistance of a pump. In Figure III, 2 long pipes can be 
            seen at the bottom of the chamber; they are included so that drugs can be delivered to the system so study the dynamics. 
            Figure IV shows an assembly of these structures, some margins are given to the meshes because after printing with Form 3 
            multiple times, the printer doesn’t print with good precision for small scale projects. Figure V shows a fluid stimulation 
            of the system: a turbulent flow system exists on the platform while the drug delivery will be going through a relatively 
            laminar at the bottom. </p>

        <p>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A device, although discarded due to the sensitivity of cells for the downward flow, has been designed such that it 
            <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4537716/">theoretically<a> maintains a laminar flow within the system. 
            The project and the flow stimulation are shown 
            in Figure VI and Figure VII.

            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The mechanical testing device is the most exciting part of my endeavour. Two force sensors, whose resistances change predictably 
            with force applied to the surface, have been <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pressure-Precise-Force-Sensitive-Resistor-Resistance-type/dp/B07T1CHY58/ref=asc_df_B07T1CHY58/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=475788796522&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1748295741168025868&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9016853&hvtargid=pla-1002375752122&psc=1">purchased</a>. Based on the datasheet, a Force(g) - Resistance(ohms) relationship 
             has been derived on Google Sheet; a relationship of higher accuracy needs to be obtained but it’s functionally 
             reliable for experimental purposes. Using the principle of voltage divider, the resistance across the force
              sensor is calculated and further converted into force with a little bit code on Arduino. Along with the known surface property of the force sensor(8mm 
              in diameter), the pressure on the surface can be calculated.

            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp An ultrasonic sensor will be incorporated into the system to measure the distance change such that Young’s Modulus can 
            be calculated with the device. A pushing mechanism(shown in Figure XI) will be driven by a DC motor and controlled by a 
            joystick to enable the movement of the device. A physical image of the current circuit is shown in Figure IX. An incomplete 
            circuit diagram is in Figure X(the software doesn’t have a joystick or a power supply).

            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A linear actuator has been designed but it requires further modifications after simulation
            to reduce the risk of mechanical failures.
