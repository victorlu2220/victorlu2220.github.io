            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
                The goal of this project is to build a cytocompatible platform for cell study. With this affordable and simple platform, researchers in the lab can introduce
                various innovative dental treatments to the microchip and evaluate their potential to promote cell growth in vitro.

            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
                Microscopy images are tricky to deal with sometimes. With stained cells in an image, it's not guaranteed that all stain will be apparent for human identification.
                Thus, a deep-learning based algorithm along with an unsupervised machine learning model are developed to help with such identification process.

            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
                Mussels can cling to rocks for decades without being washed away by sea waves due to the secretion of byssal threads, with dopamine playing a significant 
                role in enhancing the adhesive properties of these threads. In this study, we investigated whether dopamine can increase the adhesiveness of gelatin 
                methacryloyl (GelMA), a well-known biocompatible hydrogel. Our goal is to develop a bioadhesive that could potentially replace surgical sutures in the future.

            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
                Worldwide, around 5% of the population has had a stroke in their lifetime and 80% of these patients experienced an upper limb hemiparesis(Olsen, 2023). This project 
                aims to help those patients in their rehabilitation process by detecting the EMG signals on the patientâ€™s wrist and guide them to do different motions through an 
                interactive maze game.

            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
                Unicameral Bone Cysts(UBCs) are found primarily in children and cause severe pain if left untreated. One available treatment is patient-specific bone implantation.
                In this project, I collaborated with my team to synthesize multiple artificial bone grafts that achieved Young's modulus comparable to that of native humerus bone. We 
                also designed a functional bioreactor to study the in vitro behavior of the bone graft.

            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
                Ball Defender is definitely one of my favorite games to play on a flight. However, it's missing its glorious presence on the Internet. To overcome the suffer brought
                by jetlag, I decided to <a href="https://victorlu2220.github.io/Ball-Defender/">code</a> it out.
