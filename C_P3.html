        <h2 align="center">Abstract: </h2>
        <div class="pDiv"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Unicameral Bone Cysts(UBCs) are found primarily in children and cause severe pain if left untreated. 
            During treatment, surgeons extract fluid from the cysts and fill the void with bone-graft biomaterial. 
            This surgical treatment can be expensive and requires a longer recovery period. In order to minimize cost
             and recovery time, a minimally invasive treatment procedure is ideal. The goal of this project is to create 
             a bone-graft biomaterial that is easily injected into the USB that can still mimic the mechanical properties of 
             natural bone. To test this biomaterial, a bioreactor will also be fabricated to test the samples in an environment 
             that mimics the in vivo conditions in the body. The final injectable biomaterial will help make UBS treatment more accessible to patients by providing a minimally invasive 
             treatment that lowers cost and recovery time. <br><br><br>

            <h2 align="center"> Conclusion: </h2>
            <div id="conclusion">
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Native bones have Young's modulus range from 10 to 3000 MPa. The average Young's modulus of the 
                bone grafts created fall well between this range. P-value of the Student t-test suggests that there is not enough information
                to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between 2 groups. This is a good sign because a short, 2-week
                testing shouldn't have led to a significant change in physical properties. However, a good coefficient of variance(CV) is usually below .3, the 
                CV of both groups are therefore not ideal. This yields the concern of inconsistency across samples.

            <h2 align="center"> Future Considerations: </h2>

            <div id="future">
                <li><b>Code: </b><br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  The code currently records data relatively rapid(15 seconds) with respect to a 2-week testing period. EEPROM only has 
                    1024 starage places. Therefore, the resulting data set only showcases a snapshot of the variation in temperature and it does not showcase 
                    a macroscopic version of how the temperature varies. A longer interval could be considered. 
                </li><br>
                <li><b>Bioreactor: </b> <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In-vivo condition has a mobile fluid system. Thus, a spinning component could be integrated within the bioreactor to stir the 
                    fluid and mimic such a condition, which will promote the precision of the outcome of the experiment. 
                </li><br>
                <li><b>Bone Graft Samples: </b> <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Current bone graft samples are simply mechanically comparable to native bones. Its chemical properties are yet to be tested. 
                    Moreover, they should be advanced to a level that can enable angiogenesis and the growth of osteoblast. The degradation rate should also be measured 
                    so that it could match with that of the native bones. Chemicals such as hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, polyethylene glycol and methyl cellulose could be
                    integrated to bone grafts to improve their compressive strength and injectabiity.
