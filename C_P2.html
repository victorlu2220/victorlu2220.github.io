        <h2 align="center">Abstract: </h2>
        <div id="abstract">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dr. Paul Campagnola and his lab work to fabricate extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds to support research in the development
         of new cancer diagnostic tools [1]. Currently, the lab’s fabrication process of ECM scaffolds is lengthy and inefficient due 
         to the inability to recollect protein solutions for future fabrications. Through the current process, many expensive and 
         undamaged proteins are wasted due to an inability of recollection. The team was tasked in designing a an automated closed 
         system capable of introducing and recovering unpolymerized protein solution for reuse in the fabrication process. A prototype
          of the microfluidic device was fabricated, assembled, and connected to piezoelectric pumps and a driver board. 
          This device will support automated processing in the client’s lab’s fabrication, allowing for more efficient and 
          cost-effective ECM synthesis. <div><br><hr>

        <h2 align="center">Result: </h2>
            <div class="result">
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Liquid could be driven to the chamber with a <b>maximum</b> measured flow rate of <b>.52 mL/min</b>. Shortly
                after the chamber was filled up with liquid, it began to <b>leak</b>. The pump system usually <b>stopped
                functioning</b> when the frequency reached <b>18 HZ</b>.

            <h2 align="center">Future Considerations: </h2>
            <div class="result">
                <li><b>Clamping Mechanism: </b><br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The current clamping system isn't tight enough due to many factors. 
                    Its minute size making the nuts and bolts hard to be tightened. The clamping force also
                    isn't distributed well ideally the surface. Certain points are prone to failure due to shear stress 
                    and bending moment.  
                </li><br>
                <li><b>Oscilloscope: </b> <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The oscilloscope is big in size and is inconvenient to be carried around. Its function
                    is to change the frequency so that the driver board of the pump functions and achieves an ideal flow rate. 
                    If an advanced code could be written to replace the function of oscilloscope, the project would be better. 
                </li><br>
                <li><b>Flow Rate: </b> <br>
                    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The maximum flow rate obtained, .52 mL/min, is much lower than 3 mL/min, a requirement from
                    our client. In the future, an Arduino amplifying circuit system could be designed to potentially increase the flow
                    rate.
