            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333; text-align: left;">
                With a 3D printed mold, we used polymers made from mixing silicone elastomer (Sylgard 184) and its curing agent at a 10:1 ratio to copy the detailed structure 
                of the mold. A dentin is placed in the middle of the channel, cell suspension is introduced from the top of the chip, and microscopy images are taken to 
                study the cell behaviors over the course of time.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; color: #333; text-align: left;">
                When microscopy image is taken after staining, it is observed that cells percipitate and proliferate on top of the dentin disk. Boundaries between individual nucleus 
                aren't apparent enough for quantification of cells. However, it is still helpful to determine the area ratio between red and green regions to understand the cell viability. 
                Hence, a project-specific <a href="https://victorlu2220.github.io/cell-viability-calculator/"> algorithm</a> is developed and published on a github to calculate this rgb-based area ratio.

                The bright green region at the bottom indicates dentin, while the remaining green areas represent living cell membranes(stained after biochemical reaction happened at the surface of a healthy membrane),
                and the red regions denote dead cells(stained after the dye entered the malfunctioned cell membrane and reacted with nucleus).

            <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;"> Develop a 4-electrode system to monitor cell populations in real-time. Cell membranes act as natural barriers to current flow due to their insulating 
                lipid bilayer and surface charge, meaning that an increase in the number of live cells within a fixed-volume medium will likely result in higher electrical resistance. The 4-electrode 
                system, which uses one pair of electrodes for voltage measurement and another pair for current supply, minimizes interference from capacitive effects at the electrode-solution interface, 
                thereby enhancing the accuracy of the voltage measurements. Such a design should enable us to observe qualitative change in the device.
