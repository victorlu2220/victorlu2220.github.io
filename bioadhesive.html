                50mM, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid(MES) buffer is prepared with pH 4.5. Then the buffer is degassed in an ultrasonic 
                machine for an hour. N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride(EDC) and N-Hydroxysuccinimide(NHS) is added 
                to the MES buffer with stirring and heating. Dopamine hydrochloride is dissolved in MES buffer at pH 3.3 and then added to
                the mixture. The mixture reacts for a day in the dark with stirring. Then dialysis is used to purify the solution with DI water 
                at pH 3 and then DI water with pH 5. Lyophilization is performed on the purified solution to get the final product.

                Rheology tests, including shear thinning, temperature sweep and amplitude sweep, are performed on the samples to evaluate their viscosity behavior, 
                thermal stability, and mechanical properties under different conditions. Compression, shear tests and peeling tests are also performed 
                to understand the material behavior under normal and shear stresses.
