        <h2>Problem Statement: </h2>
            <div id="PS">Scratchy, the skunk of <b>Henry Vilas Zoo</b>, lacks daily exercise. It is difficult for her to maintain a <b>proper physical form</b> 
                for a skunk while living in a zoo. The design prioritizes <b>portability and safety</b>, so that the zookeepers can 
                easily move the product and ensure the safety of Scratchy.</div><br><hr>

        <h2>Final Design: </h2>
            <div class="Pdiv">
                <img src="C_P1_fTreadmill.png" height="150px" width="230px" id="treadmill"> <div class="Cdiv"> This is a <u>wood-based treadmill</u>. The wood was free 
                because it was gathered from <u>wasted materials</u>. The belt that rotates along the surface is made out of <u> denim</u>, it was sewed to both ends.
                It would able to freely rotate under the weight of a skunk as it has been tested <u>using a group member's cat</u></div>.

                <img src="C_P1_Maze.png" height="150px" width="230px" id="maze"> <div class="Cdiv">This is the final picture of the maze. The maze was modeled using simple <u>SolidWorks</u> 
                features. The materials chosen for the final design were <u>HDF</u>, because of its cost-efficiency and longevity, and <u>acrylic</u>, because of its transparency. Each individual piece 
                was then produced using a <u>lasercutter</u>. Some <u>feathers</u> were hung in the structure because such decoration is liked by skunks. Acrylic walls were used to enclosed the strucutre 
                because it's easier for the zookeepers to keep track of the condition within the structure. </div> </div> <br> <hr></div>
